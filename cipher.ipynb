Each line of the cipher is in a 'number:word' key format. When the numbers are sorted into a pyramid structure - with each line of the pyramid being comprised of the total instance of numbers 1 greater than the line before it - the last number's word pairing returns a word to be used in the final cipher. \n\nThe *decode* function expects the text file as an input, separates the number:word pairings into a Pandas dataframe which is then sorted (ascending) to maintain the integrity of pairings. Once sorted, a *for* loop is utilized to create the pyramid structure used to map the last number in each line of the pyramid to its associated word-pairing housed in the aforementioned Pandas DataFrame. When each text to be used in the final cipher is found, it is stored until all text has been gathered for a final output.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\n\ndef decode(message_file) -> str:\n    # empty list for holding number-word pairs\n    code = []\n    # loops through test file to append number-word pairs to initialized list\n    with open(message_file, 'r') as file:\n        for line in file:\n            number_word = [line.strip().split(' ')]\n            code.append(number_word)\n    \n    # create dictionary for storing number-word pairs\n    number_pairs = {'number': [], 'word': []}\n\n    # appends components of number-word pairs from text file to dictionary\n    for every_pair in code:\n        for i in every_pair:\n            number = int(i[0])\n            word = str(i[1])\n            number_pairs['number'].append(number)\n            number_pairs['word'].append(word)\n            \n    # create table to house number-word pairs for functions & visual aid  \n    code_df = pd.DataFrame(number_pairs)\n    \n    # copying data frame to not alter original text import\n    sorted_df = code_df.copy()\n    # sorting values in order of ascending numbers from text file (keeping associations)\n    sorted_df = sorted_df.sort_values(by=['number']).reset_index(drop=True)\n    \n    # initializations for use in creating pyramid structure\n    pyramid = []\n    sublist = []\n    sublist_length = 1\n    next_nums = list(sorted_df['number'])\n\n    # loops through number in sorted number list\n    for number in next_nums:\n        # stores & appends current number\n        sublist.append(number)\n        # compares to running tracker of previous pyramid line for growth of pyramid\n        if len(sublist) == sublist_length:\n            pyramid.append(sublist)\n            sublist = []\n            sublist_length += 1\n            \n    # creates list of last numbers \n    last_number = [num[-1] for num in pyramid]\n    \n    cipher = '' # initialization\n    # loops through list of last numbers\n    for last in last_number:\n        # maps number to paired-word from dataframe & appends to cipher\n        cipher += sorted_df.loc[(sorted_df.number == last), 'word'].iloc[0] + ' '\n        \n    return cipher.strip()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-08-04T06:25:00.168469Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-08-04T06:25:00.168886Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-08-04T06:25:00.633254Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-08-04T06:25:00.168854Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-08-04T06:25:00.632162Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"'''\n- calls 'decode' function\n- replace path with expected text file location \n'''\ndecode('/kaggle/input/code-text/coding_qual_input.txt')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-08-04T06:25:01.947608Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-08-04T06:25:01.949258Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-08-04T06:25:01.988309Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-08-04T06:25:01.949196Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-08-04T06:25:01.987201Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"execution_count":4,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"'young system present student lot experiment strong crease sun company hurry remember milk us repeat clothe against meant history indicate pitch print bread would'"},"metadata":{}}]}]}
